One
of
the
world's
earliest
permanently
settled
regions
present-day
Turkey
was
home
to
important
Neolithic
sites
like
Göbekli
Tepe
and
was
inhabited
by
ancient
civilisations
such
as
the
Hattians
other
Anatolian
peoples
and
Mycenaean
Greeks
Following
the
conquests
of
Alexander
the
Great
which
started
the
Hellenistic
period
most
of
the
ancient
regions
in
modern
Turkey
were
culturally
Hellenised
which
continued
during
the
Byzantine
era
The
Seljuk
Turks
began
migrating
in
the
11th
century
and
the
Sultanate
of
Rum
ruled
Anatolia
until
the
Mongol
invasion
in
1243
when
it
disintegrated
into
small
Turkish
principalities
Beginning
in
the
late
13th
century
the
Ottomans
united
the
principalities
and
conquered
the
Balkans
and
the
Turkification
of
Anatolia
increased
during
the
Ottoman
period
After
Mehmed
II
conquered
Constantinople
(Istanbul)
in
1453
Ottoman
expansion
continued
under
Selim
I
During
the
reign
of
Suleiman
the
Magnificent
the
Ottoman
Empire
became
a
global
power
From
the
late
18th
century
onwards
the

power
declined
with
a
gradual
loss
of
territories
Mahmud
II
started
a
period
of
modernisation
in
the
early
19th
century
The
Young
Turk
Revolution
of
1908
restricted
the
authority
of
the
Sultan
and
restored
the
Ottoman
Parliament
after
a
30-year
suspension
ushering
the
empire
into
a
multi-party
period
The
1913
coup
d'état
put
the
country
under
the
control
of
the
Three
Pashas
who
facilitated
the
Empire's
entry
into
World
War
I
as
part
of
the
Central
Powers
in

against
its
Armenian

Greek
subjects
After
its
defeat
in
the
war
the
Ottoman
Empire
was
partitioned
The
Turkish
War
of
Independence
against
the
occupying
Allied
Powers
resulted
in
the
abolition
of
the
Sultanate
on
1
November
1922
the
signing
of
the
Treaty
of
Lausanne
(which
superseded
the
Treaty
of
Sèvres)
on
24
July
1923
and
the

of
the
Republic
on
29
October
1923

and
joined
NATO
in

endured
several
military
coups
in
the
latter
half
of
the
20th
century
The
economy
was
liberalised
in
the
1980s
leading
to
stronger
economic
growth
and
political
stability
The
parliamentary
republic
was
replaced
with
a
presidential
system
by
referendum
in
